## Introduction

The challenge was to simulate a podcast player through a web interface with a list of available episodes to listen to.

## Technical Decisions

Here is an overview of my technical choices for the project:

###Â Code Formatting

Prettier is used for code formatting, VSCode is setup to format all files on save.

### Redux

As we discussed Redux extensively during our call I decided to use redux in the project. It consists of:

- One set of actions for controlling the state of the application (podcasts_actions.js).
- One reducer to reflect the state of the application (podcasts_reducer.js).
- Custom middleware for controlling audio playback.

### A PodcastPlayer library

During my time working with React, I have found that it is best to extract functionality away from components themselves and into external libraries that can be independently tested. PodcastPlayer.js contains the functionality for loading, playing, pausing and assigning `oncanplaythrough` and `onended` callback functions.

### Styles

There is a basic CSS reset file for covering all browsers.
Otherwise all components are styled with the `styled-components` library.

### Testing

I have made various decisions with the unit tests.

- Components should be abstracted away from a Connected store when being tested, they should be tested independently of any 3rd party libraries.
- Components are all tested with a snapshot and unit tests that cover basic functionality.
- PodcastPlayer and audio middleware are tested with spies for HTMLMediaElement functions. This means we can test in a jsdom environment rather than in the browser.
- Actions are pure functions that return type and payload and so are easy to test. For the one async action, the store is mocked and the actions dispatched are compared to the order they were received by the store.
- Tests should live directly in the same directory as the files they are testing.
- Mock data is used from the test folder.

## Local Install

- Install dependencies `yarn`
- Start the development server `yarn start`
- Go to `localhost:3000`

## Deployment

Continuous deployment with testing is handled by Netlify.
